=============

An automatic checkin application using iBeacons. 

It's a simple App that sends a POST request to a rails backend when a user enters or exits a given iBeacon region. It was made while playing around with iBeacons.

##Installation
Before running the sample, make a copy of `settings.json.sample` in the Resources folder as `settings.json`, replacing the sample data with your settings.
Check out our [Rails backend](https://github.com/FancyPixel/whosfancy-rails) to have the full sample working in no time.
